h1. jquery-json - a jspath plugin

jquery-json is a jspath plugin that provides some json utilities based on results from 

http://weblogs.asp.net/yuanjian/archive/2009/03/22/json-performance-comparison-of-eval-new-function-and-json.aspx

to make json evaluation as fast as possible for the given browser environment.  
It also provides a thin wrapper around JSON.org/json2.js so you easily decide
when to treat the evaluation safely, as well as it's serialization routines as well.
